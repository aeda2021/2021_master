# Read in and examine bee data
# Spobee column has density of P. larvae spores (the bacterium). 
# Hive has the ID of the hive sampled (3 samples/hive)
# Infection has a metric quantifying the degree of infection. We will turn this into yes/no whether infection is present. 
Bees <- read.table(url('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aeda2021/2021_master/main/data/Bees.txt'), header=TRUE)
head(Bees)

# make hive a factor
Bees$fhive <- factor(Bees$Hive)

# Make a yes/no infection column (Infection01)
Bees$Infection01 <- Bees$Infection 
Bees$Infection01[Bees$Infection01 > 0] <- 1
Bees$fInfection01 <- factor(Bees$Infection01) # turn this into a factor

# Scale BeesN to improve model convergence (mean 0, standard deviation 1)
Bees$sBeesN <- scale(Bees$BeesN)


# Make a Cleveland dot-chart of spores vs. hive
dotchart(Bees$Spobee, groups = Bees$fhive, xlab='Spores', ylab='Hive ID')


# Q1. Does variance of spore density appear homogenous among hives? Why or why not?



# Q2. Try some transformations of the response variable to homogenize the variances (or at least improve it). Which transformation of spore density seems reasonable? Why?



# Q3. Develop a simple linear model for transformed spore density. Include infection (fInfection01), number of bees (sBeesN) and their interaction as explanatory variables. Check for a hive effect by plotting standardized residuals (see the residuals(yourmodel, type='pearson') function) against hive ID (fhive). Show your code and your plots. Do residuals look homogenous among hives?





# Q4. What are the advantages of including hive as a random effect, rather than as a fixed effect?



# Apply the Zuur protocol (10-step version outlined here, as used with the barn owl nesting data in Zuur Ch. 5):
# Step 1: Fit and check a "beyond optimal" linear regression (already done above)
# Step 2: Fit a generalized least squares version of the "beyond optimal" model (no need: we will use the linear regression model).

# Q5. Step 3. Choose a variance structure or structures (the random effects). What random effects do you want to try?


# We will now fit a mixed effects (ME) model. Zuur et al. used the nlme package in R, but Douglas Bates now has a newer package that is widely used and that is called lme4. The benefits of lme4 include greater flexibility in the structure of the random effects, the option to use non-Gaussian error structures (for generalized linear mixed effects models, or GLMMs), and more efficient code to fit models. The main difference between nlme's lme() function and the lmer() function in lme4 is in how random effects are specified:
# model <- lmer(response ~ explanantoryvars + (1|random), data=mydata) # a random intercept model
# model <- lmer(response ~ explanantoryvars + (slope|random), data=mydata) # a random intercept and slope model
# One of the frustrations some people run into is that the lme4 package doesn't provide p-values. This stems from disagreements and uncertainty about how best to calculate p-values. However, if p-values are important to you, approximate p-values can be derived from the lmerTest package

# install.packages('lme4') # if needed
# install.packages('lmerTest') if needed
require(lmerTest)

# Q6. Step 4. Fit the "beyond optimal" ME model(s) with lmer() in the lme4 package (transformed spore density is response, fInfection01, sBeesN, and interaction are the explanatory variables). Show your code.




# Q7. Step 5. Compare the linear regression and ME model(s) with a likelihood ratio test, including correction for testing on the boundary if needed. Use the anova() command. This will re-fit your lmer model with maximum likelihood, but this is OK (note there are some debates about exactly how to best compare an lm and lmer model). Show your work and the results. Which random effect structure do you choose based on the results?





# Q8. Step 6. Check the model: plot standardized residuals vs. fitted values and vs. each predictor. (You can get standardized residuals with residuals(yourmodel, type='pearson')). How do they look?






# Q9. Step 7. Re-fit the full model with ML (set REML=FALSE) and compare against a reduced model without the interaction term, also fit with ML. Use anova() to compare the models. Which model do you choose? Why?





# Q10. Step 8. Iterate #7 to arrive at the final model. Show your work. What is your final set of fixed effects?





# Q11. Step 9. Fit the final model with REML. Check assumptions by plotting a histogram of residuals, plotting Pearson standardized residuals vs. fitted values, and plotting Pearson standardized residuals vs. explanatory variables. Are there issues with the model? If so, how might you address them?




# Q12. Step 10. Interpret the model. The summary() command is useful here. What have you learned about American Foulbrood? 





# Q13. Calculate the correlation between observations from the same hive as variance(fhive random effect)/(variance(fhive random effect) + variance(residual)). Given the correlation among observations from the same hive, do you think it's a good use of time to sample each hive multiple times? Why or why not?
